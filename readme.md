##Tornado server for Dropzone

--------

Draging file into page for uploading is a cool experience when we use browser.

[Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) is an easy to use drag'n'drop library. 

I coded this tornado server for Dropzone upload sample page, and this sample works well with my Linux-PC.

Suppose you have placed this sample in $(MAINDIR)


        1. shell > cd $(MAINDIR)
        2. shell > python webserver.py
        3. browser > localhost:8964
        4. shell > ls uploads
